# Tech Lead Assessment - DevOps & Infrastructure

## Overview
Take our existing application and make it production-ready with modern DevOps practices.

## What You'll Get
- Working codebase (frontend + backend + database)
- Your task: Transform it for production use

## Required Tasks

### 1. Monorepo Setup
- [ ] Convert to Turbo/Nx/Lerna structure
- [ ] Configure build pipeline
- [ ] Document commands and workflows

### 2. Containerization
- [ ] Create Dockerfiles for each service
- [ ] Set up Docker Compose for local development
- [ ] Add health checks

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Automated testing and linting
- [ ] Deployment automation
- [ ] Build optimization

### 4. Code Quality
- [ ] Add Husky git hooks
- [ ] Configure linting and formatting
- [ ] Set up pre-commit checks
- [ ] Add test coverage

### 5. Database Management
- [ ] Backup strategy implementation
- [ ] Migration system setup
- [ ] Environment configurations

## Optional Advanced Tasks
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (any tool)
- [ ] Monitoring setup (Prometheus/Grafana or similar)
- [ ] Live deployment (appreciated but not required)

## Deliverables

### 1. Enhanced Codebase
- Monorepo structure
- Docker setup
- CI/CD pipeline
- Quality tools configured

### 2. Documentation
- `README.md` - Setup and deployment instructions
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Your design decisions and trade-offs
- `OPERATIONS.md` - How to run and maintain the application

### 3. Demo
Be ready to show:
- Local development workflow
- CI/CD pipeline in action
- Deployment process
- Your architectural decisions

## Evaluation Focus
- **Code Organization**: Clean monorepo structure and build setup
- **Automation**: Effective CI/CD and quality gates
- **Production Readiness**: Docker, backups, deployment strategy
- **Decision Making**: Technology choices and trade-off analysis
- **Documentation**: Clear setup and operational guides

## Questions?
Reach out if you need any clarification on the requirements.
